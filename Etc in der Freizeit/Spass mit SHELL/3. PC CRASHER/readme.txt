========================3-Line PC Crasher========================

Probably the oldest troll that exists.

This script works by starting the same script file over and over again until
the memory gets overloaded and your PC crashes (BLUE SCREEN MAY OCCUR)

THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! MISUSE OF THE PROVIDED CODE
FOR PROHIBITED OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES CAN HAVE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES!

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS!

========================HOW IT WORKS========================

The Script consists of 4 lines of Code, the first which can be left out.

@ECHO off - prevents the SHELL from showing the actions it is performing

:a- along with -goto a- creates a (in this case) never-ending loop

start run.bat - starts the batch file again in a seperate window

And that is pretty much all there is to it!
